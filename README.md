EXPLORING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AIRLINE FLIGHT DELAYS AND WEATHER CONDITIONS

*Question/Hypothesis
Is weather the most common reason for airline departure delays?

*Consolidating and Merging the Data
Historical weather data by weather condition type 2017-2019
American Airlines,Delta, and United Airlines departure delays from ORD 2017-2019.

*Conclusion

*It was interesting to see the the various reasons recorded for departing flight 
delays at O’Hare for our sample group and date range. 

*We discovered that weather is not the principle factor in the delay of flight 
departures, in fact it ranks near the bottom of the list of reasons that we 
analyzed. 

*Late aircraft arrival is clearly the most impactful cause of departure delays at 
O’Hare for American, United, and Delta. Given the opportunity and time, it 
would be interesting to explore the primary driving factors behind late 
arrivals of aircraft passing through O’Hare.

*We have also seen that Delta airlines records higher average delay times 
than American and United by a substantial margin.
